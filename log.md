## Day 107  : 20th February, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Working on the logic for the clock. Just setup the functions to set the timers. Now I need to get the clock working when the go button is clicked.

## Day 107  : 22nd February, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Working on the pomodoro clock FCC project. Trying to add the functionality which will let the user stop the clock.

**Thoughts:** This proves to be more difficult then initial thought.

## Day 108  : 26th February, 2018

**Today's Progress:** The user can now stop the timer when the stop button is selected. For the next session I need to ensure the break is counted down when the work time reaches 0.

**Thoughts:** This has been quite an enjoyable challenge so far. I have learned about how to use the setInterval and clearInterval JS methods. I also want to include some animation to the timer, like a progress bar.

## Day 109  : 5th March, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Working on the pomodoro clock project. I have a few bugs where the timer does not go to the default start when the stop button is pressed.

**Thoughts:** I need to find a method so that when stop is pressed the timer will go back to the GO time.

**Thoughts:** I still need to make the web page responsive, which will be the next task.  

**Link to work:** n/a

## Day 114  : 20th March, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Played around with media queries to make the webpage more responsive. I needed to restructure the HTML which broke the layout of the page. I need to fix the layout issues in my next session.

**Thoughts:** I have had some fun messing around with responsive design. Once the webpage is responsive enough using chrome. I will test it with different browsers and phone/tablet browsers.

## Day 115  : 22nd March, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Working on trying to make the web page responsive. I have had to restructure the HTML and CSS to conduct these changes. This is for the FCC Pomodoro clock challenge.

**Thoughts:** Trying to layout the page in CSS is proving to be more difficult then I thought. I am learning a lot about flexbox and media queries.

**Today's Progress:** Working on the tic tac toe FCC project. Trying to add the logic for adding the correct symbol to the correct position on the board based on the player choices.   

**Thoughts:** Trying to figure out a way to pass the element value to a click function that is bound to the perant function.

**Link to work:** n/a

## Day 121  : 10th April, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Added the functionality that will add the symbol to the game board based on the player ones choice in the previous page.

**Thoughts:** Will ensure the turns and positions are recorded by adding them to an array. This is how I will check if a player has won the game. I also need to implement the bot logic.

## Day 122  : 17th April, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Working on the win logic of the tictactoe FCC project.

**Thoughts:** Using arrays to store the win combinations and storing the player moves into relevant player objects. Creating a function to compare these 2 arrays to get the winner. May try to use an object that holds the winning combinations instead of a 2 d array.

**Link to work:** n/a

## Day 123  : 19th April, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completed the win logic for the tictactoe FCC project.

## Day 132  : 3rd June, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Working on the sum challenge of the recursion prompts challenges. Finding it hard to not mutate the array to work the sum of all the ints in the array.
